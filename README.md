# Draw It or Lose It : Game

Gaming Room client wants to extend their current web-based game Draw it or Lose It to all other platforms. Currently, this game is only on Android (Mobile Platform) and must be available on different OS platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac, and another major mobile platform, iOS. I learned how to create UML diagrams and created a UML Class Diagram and captured all classes with attributes, functions, and relationships between them. This Class diagram will be handy while coding and can be referred to for class, variable, and function names and to create relationships.

I want to improve the evaluation to capture more details and tools for each operating platform's requirements. This will help to provide accurate information for each platform application development and usage. User needs are critical and should be captured in the design document and must be reviewed and signed off before starting the development work to avoid confusion, misunderstanding, and re-work.

My approach to designing the software application is first to understand and capture the business requirement clearly, then convert each business requirement into a technical requirement and create a design document with UML diagrams.
